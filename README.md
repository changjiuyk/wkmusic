# \[WIP\]Vercel Onedrive Music Player

This is a onedrive-based music player, still working in progess.

This repository is exposed for testing, so please don't try it.

## Usage

The most common case is that music in your favourate list always be taken down by Music Apps, even if you subscribed the music services for a fee. So, you can upload your music to your Onedrive, and then open this webapp from any devices which have a broswer. All you have to do is fork this repo and deploy it to the vercel.
